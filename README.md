üß† Azure Data Warehouse Project
üìò Overview

This project implements a modern data warehouse architecture using the Azure ecosystem to enable end-to-end data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization.
The solution is designed for scalability, security, and performance ‚Äî integrating Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, Power BI, Azure Active Directory, and Azure Key Vault.
‚öôÔ∏è Components

1. Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Orchestrates data ingestion pipelines from multiple sources (e.g., APIs, SQL databases, blob storage).

Manages ETL workflows and triggers Databricks notebooks for transformations.

Uses Key Vault for securely storing connection strings and credentials.

2. Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2)

Centralized data lake divided into layers:

Raw Zone ‚Äì stores unprocessed, source-level data.

Cleaned/Transformed Zone ‚Äì stores enriched, transformed datasets.

Curated Zone ‚Äì optimized for analytics and reporting.

3. Azure Databricks

Performs large-scale data processing, cleansing, and transformation.

Implements data validation and business logic.

Writes processed data back to ADLS or directly to Synapse tables.

4. Azure Synapse Analytics

Acts as the enterprise data warehouse.

Hosts dimensional models (Star/Snowflake schema).

Supports advanced analytics and query optimization.

5. Power BI

Connects to Synapse or curated ADLS views for interactive dashboards and data visualization.

Provides KPI monitoring, trend analysis, and business reporting.

6. Azure Active Directory (AAD)

Manages user authentication and access control across all Azure resources.

Integrates with Power BI and Synapse for role-based security.

7. Azure Key Vault

Securely stores credentials, tokens, and connection strings.

Accessed by ADF, Databricks, and Synapse for secure configuration management.

üß© Data Flow Summary

Ingestion: ADF fetches data from on-premises or cloud sources ‚Üí loads into ADLS Raw Zone.

Transformation: Databricks cleans, joins, and aggregates data ‚Üí writes to Curated Zone or Synapse.

Storage: Curated data is stored in Synapse Analytics for downstream analytics.

Visualization: Power BI connects to Synapse for dashboarding and reporting.

Security: AAD controls access; Key Vault secures secrets.

üîê Security and Governance

Azure Active Directory (AAD) ensures secure and centralized identity management.

Azure Key Vault manages sensitive configuration values (connection strings, access tokens).

Data Lake Access controlled via RBAC and ACLs.

Network Security implemented via private endpoints and VNET integration.

üß† Best Practices

Modular pipeline design in ADF for reusability.

Parameterized Databricks notebooks and ADF pipelines.

Delta Lake tables for ACID-compliant transformations.

Use Synapse views for semantic consistency across Power BI models.

Implement row-level security in Power BI using AAD roles.

üöÄ Deployment Steps

Provision Azure Resources

Create resource group and deploy required services.

Configure Key Vault

Store secrets and link to ADF, Databricks, and Synapse.

Set Up Data Lake Structure

Create Raw, Cleaned, and Curated containers.

Develop ADF Pipelines

Configure linked services, datasets, and data flows.

Build Databricks Transformations

Implement ETL logic in notebooks.

Load Data into Synapse

Use ADF or Databricks to populate dimensional models.

Connect Power BI

Build and publish dashboards connected to Synapse.

Apply Security Controls

Enforce AAD-based access and Key Vault secrets management.

üìä Example Use Case

A retail company ingests sales, customer, and inventory data from multiple systems into Azure.
The solution provides near real-time dashboards in Power BI showing:

Sales trends by region and product

Customer churn analysis

Inventory forecasting and optimization

üß© Future Enhancements

Integrate Azure Purview for data cataloging and lineage.

Add real-time streaming with Azure Event Hubs or Stream Analytics.

Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps.
